        <p style="padding:10px;border-bottom:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.1);"><strong>ITALIAN SAUSAGE SOUP WITH WHITE BEANS AND SPINACH</strong></p>
        <p style="text-indent:40px;font-style:italic;font-size:90%;padding:20px;">Well hello there from an 80-degree October day in New Jersey. I’m not complaining, but I’m also not about to be demure with the soup. It’s decorative gourd season, mofos. (Never gets old, am I right?) And that means it’s soup season too. Second time in a week (oh hi, Monday soup), and I’m not sorry. Today we’re all about Italian sausage soup with white beans, spinach and pasta shells.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:40px;font-style:italic;font-size:90%;padding:20px;">This easy soup sports a tomato-ish broth situation. It’s hearty and veggie-packed. It feeds a small crowd or a family for a couple of weeknight dinners. It’s quick to make. And we’re eating it for dinner this very evening, in a house that’s getting stuffy because I’m too lazy to open the windows. I mean, I’d open them, but then I might have to close them in the morning if it’s freezing, and that’s just hard.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:40px;font-style:italic;font-size:90%;padding:20px;">I blame decorative gourds.</p>

        <p style="text-indent:40px;font-style:italic;font-size:90%;padding:20px;">Here’s a protip for anytime you make soup with pasta in it. Consider cooking the pasta separately and tossing it with a little olive oil. Then, when you’re ready to serve, stir some pasta into the soup in each individual serving bowl. That way the pasta won’t slurp up all the broth before you have a chance to. This is an especially good idea when you might have leftovers. You know I’m not into shoulds. But this is a good call, just sayin.</p>
        <p style="text-indent:40px;font-style:italic;font-size:90%;padding:20px;">That’s all for today. Talk to you soon.</p>
