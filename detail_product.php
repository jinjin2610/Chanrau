         <p style="padding:10px;border-bottom:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.1);"><strong>Nutrition and health</strong></p>
         <p style="text-indent:40px;font-style:italic;font-size:90%;padding:20px;">Vegetables play an important role in human nutrition. Most are low in fat and calories but are bulky and filling.They supply dietary fiber and are important sources of essential vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Particularly important are the antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E. When vegetables are included in the diet, there is found to be a reduction in the incidence of cancer, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and other chronic ailments.Research has shown that, compared with individuals who eat less than three servings of fruits and vegetables each day, those that eat more than five servings have an approximately twenty percent lower risk of developing coronary heart disease or stroke. The nutritional content of vegetables varies considerably; some contain useful amounts of protein though generally they contain little fat,and varying proportions of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin K, and vitamin B6; provitamins; dietary minerals; and carbohydrates.</p>
         <p style="padding:10px;border-bottom:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.1);"><strong>Dietary recommendations</strong></p>
         <p style="text-indent:20px;font-style:italic;font-size:90%;padding:20px;">The USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends consuming five to nine servings of fruit and vegetables daily.The total amount consumed will vary according to age and gender, and is determined based upon the standard portion sizes typically consumed, as well as general nutritional content. Potatoes are not included in the count as they are mainly providers of starch. For most vegetables and vegetable juices, one serving is half of a cup and can be eaten raw or cooked. For leafy greens, such as lettuce and spinach, a single serving is typically a full cup.A variety of products should be chosen as no single fruit or vegetable provides all the nutrients needed for health.International dietary guidelines are similar to the ones established by the USDA. Japan, for example, recommends the consumption of five to six servings of vegetables daily.French recommendations provide similar guidelines and set the daily goal at five servings.In India, the daily recommendation for adults is 275 grams (9.7 oz) of vegetables per day.</p>
